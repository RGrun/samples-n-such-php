samples-n-such-php
==================

Miscellaneous PHP scripts from projects I've worked on.

These samples come from a variety of different projects. I figure I might as well put them here online rather than have
them just rot on my hard drive.

I'm mostly a heuristic learner, so these scripts, in a way, chronicle my learning process.
If you have any questions about any of these scripts, shoot me an email at richard@r3software.org.
